            <h4>The why</h4>
            <p>I´ve decided to write this list i guess you can say to the universe. 
                <br>
                The last few years have been challeging, to say the least.
                <br>
                Not just the resent pandamic, but on a personal level.
                <br>
                Deppression and anxiety, a break up, finacial insecurety the list goes on.
                <br>
                So like the rest of the world, i want to leave past years behind and start anew.
                <br>
                This are the things i dream of and challenges to overcome, for what i hope will be my year!

            <h4>The swdish classic</h4>
            <p>I will have a challange with this one!
                So the swedish classic is basically a compilation of four big swedish races.
                <br>
                The races or competitions, are in four different diciplines:
                <br>
                Cross country skiing, cykling, open water swimming and cross country running.
                <br>
                The different races are called: Vasaloppet, Vätternrundan, Vansbrosimmet och Lidingöloppet.
                <br>
                And you are to complete these different races during a 12-month period.
                <br>
                In Vasaloppet you cross country skii for 90 kilometers, this is in march. 
                <br>
                In Vätternrundan you do cykling for 300 kilometers, this is in june.
                <br>
                In Vansbrosimmet you open water swim for 3 kilometers, this is in july.
                <br>
                And at Lidingöloppet you do cross country running for 30 kilometers, this is in september.
                <br>
                After you complete these four events, you recieve a diploma. Can´t wait to se how hard i can push myself!

            <h4>The magic of midnight sun</h4>
            <p>I´ve dreamt of seeing the midnight sun for so long.
                <br>
                This is a phenomenon that occurs in the northest parts of Sweden.
                During a few days the sun does not set.
                <br>
                It basically reaches the horizon and stops there.
                The summers in sweden is always very bright even in the late hours.
                <br>
                But, if you go up north, the day does not seam to end. 
                <br>
                My wish is to go there with a close friend, or alone and just watch this magical moment.
            </p>

            <h4>My last initiation to adulthood</h4>
            <p>A driving license is something that gives you more freedom, and increases your chances to get hierd.
                <br>
                Ofcourse i wanted one for a long time, but i have neither had the time or recources to get one.
                <br>
                Now i have more time to dedicate and some recourses to fund my driving license.
                <br>
                I would also like to get a car, my dream car is an vintage volkswagen van, but one step at a time!

        <section id="fifth paragraph"> 
            <h4>One apartment garden comming up!</h4>
            <p>One day i will have a house, with the most wonderful garden there is.
                <br>
                There will be vegtebles, berrys, fruit trees, chicken and bees.
                <br>
                But for now i will start growing what i can at home. To bring in more green and colour to my life.
                <br>
                Watching something grow, that you planted and nurtured is one of the most satisfiyng thing i know.
                <br>
                I´ve had a few plants before, but this year i will fill as much of my apartment i can with life.

            <h3>The most important</h3>
            <p> Happiness is something so hard to describe, and yet there are endless ways.
                <br>
                It´s something so important, but somehow neglected for things that seem more urgent.
                <br>
                It can be lost in darkness, and you dare not hope for it´s return. Becouse not reaching it hurts.
                <br>
                Happiness in the little thing, happiness in the grand, happiness you find in others and the happiness within.
                <br>
                This one will be my biggest challange, but the one i cannot fail.
            </p>
